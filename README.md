# borgAuto
My customisation and automation of the fantastic Borg backup and deduplication system

## Test Files
The files

* pruner.sh
* diff.sh

were created to test and debug the functions. Once they were working I copied them into the main shell script. I could have sourced them I suppose. I've left them as simple ways to test without performing needless backups.
